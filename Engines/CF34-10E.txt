General Electric Propulsion System GE CF34-10E
==============================================

Engine Overview

GE is committed to further developing its CF34 engine family and most recently began testing of the new CF34-10, rated at 18,000 to 20,000 pounds of thrust.
The CF34-10E is the engine for the EMBRAER 190/195, which entered service in the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition, the CF34-10A has been selected to power China's new ARJ21 regional jet with a potential market of 500 aircraft totaling $3 billion and expected to enter service in 2009. The CF34-10A is designed for western China's hot/high airports.
The CF34-10 combines the most advanced technology available today with nearly 500 million flight hours of experience gained on the entire GE product line, from the GE90, the world's largest, most powerful engine, to the CF6 and CFM56, the best-selling, most reliable engines for 100-plus passenger aircraft.
Key CF34-10 design features include: a wide-chord fan blade for higher thrust and high tolerance to foreign object damage; 3-D aerodynamic design airfoils throughout the entire flowpath, providing highly efficient, stall-free operation, as well as better fuel burn and higher exhaust gas temperature margins; a highly durable single annular, low-emissions combustor that meets or surpasses the most stringent emissions standards; and a single-stage high-pressure turbine for lower operating cost.
